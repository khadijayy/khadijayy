# 👋 Hey, I'm Khadija!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Software Engineer** who's passionate about coding, problem-solving, and building awesome things that make a difference. When I'm not diving deep into **algorithms & data structures**, I'm building cool **full-stack applications**, experimenting with **game development**, or just daydreaming about the next big project. 😎

## 🚀 About Me

- 💻 Super into **backend development**, especially with **MongoDB** and **Django** — I love making things run smoothly behind the scenes.
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on **open-source projects**, **coding challenges**, or even just geek out about the latest tech.
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me with a camera in hand, snapping photos and blending creativity with code. 📸
